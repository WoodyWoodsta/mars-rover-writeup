\section*{Title}
  Development of a Mars Curiosity Rover Simulator
\section*{Description}
  Our knowledge of the planet Mars has been greatly expanded by several rovers that have landed on the planet over the past twenty years. The most capable of these is the \textit{Curiosity} Rover, which is currently exploring the surface of Mars. In an attempt to generate awareness of the effort put into planetary exploration, the project involves the development of a model of the \textit{Curiosity} Rover which replicates some of the control experiences involved in operating a rover of this type.
  
\section*{Deliverables}
  The items expected as deliverables upon completion of this project included:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item a scaled, working replica of the Mars \textit{Curiosity} exploration rover.
    \item an accompanying software system responsible for:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item operation of the rover;
        \item remote control of the rover.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item a full report outlining the design and development process of the rover and software systems.
    \item completion of all applicable ECSA ELOs.
  \end{enumerate}
  
\section*{Skills and Requirements}
  Mechanical Design, Software and Electronics Interfacing and Programming.
  
\section*{Area}
  Space Science and Technology
