\section*{Title}
  Development of a Mars Curiosity Rover Simulator for the Cape Town Science Centre
\section*{Description}
  Our knowledge of the planet Mars has been greatly expanded by several rovers that have landed on the planet over the past twenty years. The most capable of these is the Mars Science Laboratory/Curiosity Rover, which is currently exploring the surface of Mars. The Cape Town Science Centre has requested the UCT SpaceLab to design and build a model of a Mars exploration rover that will be the centrepiece of a future Mars exhibit at the Centre.
