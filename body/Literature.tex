  \section{Space Exploration and NASA's Journey to Mars}
    The human race possesses the powerful will to explore what is unknown. It is the curiosity and the thrill to push past the boundaries of what is thought to be possible, perhaps felt stronger by some, that forms the basis of many scientific endeavours relating to facts of life and existence around and outside of the environment in which we live. A prime example of such a drive to explore is in the research and exploration of outer space.
