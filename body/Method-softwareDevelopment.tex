  use the Linux tool \mintinline{js}{Video4Linux2} (\mintinline{js}{v4l2}) supporting streaming video in realtime from hardware available on the operating system, including devices of the UVC driver-less class. Another tool, \mintinline{js}{ffmpeg}, which leveraged \mintinline{js}{v4l2} for video capture, allowed the creation of an HTTP and RTSP server which could be connected to from an external endpoint on the network. However, tests performed with an \mintinline{js}{ffmepg} implementation
